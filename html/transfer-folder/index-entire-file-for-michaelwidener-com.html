The short answer is that the record label was always registered as a software developer, and software publisher. We are an interactive creator. We don't create software, we create high-end interactive experiences including the tiny animations on this profile. Yet it took more than twenty years to complete the final puzzle pieces of becoming the first of two halves of computer software development, Frontend Web Development. The last half is Backend Web Development, and the output of that journey is nearing completion and will be linked here when it's ready. It will be a web-based application and it will demonstrate my Backend Web Development. I'll be a newbie Backend Web Developer, but I will be a Full Stack Frontend Web Developer at that point. Far more than one role, capable of understanding both the front and the back end, and demonstrating that. It's not about memorizing accronyms.">

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align:center;">As of April 23rd, 2025:<br/>(Pacific Standard Time)

<br/>
<br>
<div style="text-align:justify;">This year, I launched my Twitch Channel. I tested several options for quality streaming and settled on one. Now my channel is active. 

<br>
<br/>

I play video games that have cooperative or solo play. I'm not a fan of the death matches or Player versus Player games. The only Player versus Player games I play are Table Top Games, such as Magic the Gathering or Star Wars Unlimited. I may stream the video game versions of those if I find the gaming community is free of bad actors.

<br/>
<br/>

E-Sports gaming has come a long way and the competitive play is big time. But Twitch is new, and the play there is whatever the Channel's owner makes it. That's where I enter the field. I make my Twitch Channel about learning, not personality. You won't hear voice-overs there. Not at all. You'll just see me playing a game. I'm just not a fan of having fans of personality. Be a fan of our content, not our personal, phyiscal traits, like our voices or our appearance.

Reading this you'll think it's a joke if you're not the believer in movies that I am. Movies are America's common language. More than anything else, if you share a love of the same movies, in the same language, even for the same reasons, you end up part of a familiar cohort. American movies aren't like movies anywhere else because the United States is unlike anywhere else.


<br/>
<br/>



I'm a Star Wars fan, a science fan (I read Stephen Hawking‚Äôs A Brief History of Time from cover to cover), and a fan of fantasy. For example, I love The Lord of the Rings, The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time, and all the fantastic movies that celebrate these stories. I also love Star Trek‚Äîthe celebrities who bring it to life, the people behind the scenes, and the passionate fans who dress up in cosplay. I love it all. I do not like drunkenness, rowdiness, or violence‚Äîunless it‚Äôs pretend‚Äîand I despise unfairness.

<br/>
<br/>


Why am I putting this here? Because in my quest to find myself‚Äîwhich has been my Jedi Path‚ÄîI did find me! I found the Mormon faith: Christianity of a specific and meaningful nature. It involves being an ‚Äúagent‚Äù in one's life, and it‚Äôs miraculous that I‚Äôm only now managing to join the Church. Back in 2005‚Äîtwenty years ago‚ÄîI recorded a documentary for my senior thesis, one of two, and I highlighted the concept of agency in making great video games. It turns out, ‚Äúagency‚Äù in faith was my final destination. Some of us chase our tails for life. I'm glad I caught mine!

<br/>
<br/>


I even bought The Jedi Path, a book Star Wars fans can buy that highlights the values of the Jedi. And do you know which real-world religion that book most closely mirrors? You guessed it: Mormonism. So, subconsciously and deliberately, I‚Äôve been searching for this path since I made that video‚Äîand ever since I purchased The Jedi Path in 2010, that‚Äôs 15 years ago, it stll took me this long to connect the dots. So even though I'm an honors student, I didn't feel so smart when it all dawned on me, so this is my confession that what's changed is this, not me. That faith is my calling, and now I‚Äôm there. So if you knew me before I found this, that's one thing, but if you meet me again don't be surprised if you notice a change. It's a good thing!

<br/>
<br/>


Life has a way of leading us where we need to go‚Äîif we follow one passage from Star Wars:

<br/>
<br/>
<strong><quote>‚ÄúYou will know what to do and what is true when you are calm. When you feel peaceful; not while you are angry.‚Äù</quote></strong><br/>
<b>‚Äî Yoda, Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</b>

        I‚Äôm now a Student A/V Engineer at a professional recording studio serving podcasters, recording artists, and independent filmmakers on my school's campus. I never needed anything else for what I do.  Every day, I help creators find their voice‚Äîand then make sure that voice is crystal clear, emotionally rich, and production-ready.

        <br/><br/>

        Whether I‚Äôm mic‚Äôing up a storyteller, mixing a vocal session, or mastering sound for cinema, I bring the same Jedi-level discipline I‚Äôve used in multimedia and animation: 
        balance, timing, precision, and feel. I translate raw takes into polished soundscapes that elevate the message and honor the vision.

        <br/><br/>

        This isn‚Äôt just a job. It‚Äôs a daily discipline. Audio is now the medium where my technical skills, artistic instincts, and years of digital craftsmanship meet in real time‚Äîwith real impact. 
        Every day, I make sure the story gets heard, exactly the way it‚Äôs meant to be.

    <div class="timeline-body">
      <p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">
        I‚Äôm stepping into a new frontier: fusing CSS animation with audio-reactive design‚Äîtiny, nuanced animations choreographed to my own DJ-mixed music. This isn‚Äôt just syncing beats with visuals. It‚Äôs crafting emotional, immersive ‚Äúmicro-experiences‚Äù that pulse with personality and precision. I‚Äôve always believed animation is more than eye candy‚Äîit‚Äôs timing, passion, intent, and soul. Now, I‚Äôm applying those principles in tandem with sound I personally mix.

        <br/><br/>

        What sets this apart is that the rhythm, pacing, and energy come from my own mixes‚Äîsometimes commercial tracks, sometimes my original Flirty-POP EDM productions. The result? Custom-crafted experiences that feel alive because they <em>are</em>. Designed. Mixed. Timed. All by one creative mind; and, based on my real-life experiences, so in a very real way, they are totally alive!

        <br/><br/>

        I‚Äôm not chasing flash. I‚Äôm surfing <strong>passion</strong>! Understated. Epic. Unmistakably me; but, passion none the less!

    </div>
    <div class="timeline-body">
      <p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">
        I‚Äôm stepping into a new frontier: fusing CSS animation with audio-reactive design‚Äîtiny, nuanced animations choreographed to my own DJ-mixed music. This isn‚Äôt just syncing beats with visuals. It‚Äôs crafting emotional, immersive ‚Äúmicro-experiences‚Äù that pulse with personality and precision. I‚Äôve always believed animation is more than eye candy‚Äîit‚Äôs timing, passion, intent, and soul. Now, I‚Äôm applying those principles in tandem with sound I personally mix.

        <br/><br/>

        What sets this apart is that the rhythm, pacing, and energy come from my own mixes‚Äîsometimes commercial tracks, sometimes my original Flirty-POP EDM productions. The result? Custom-crafted experiences that feel alive because they <em>are</em>. Designed. Mixed. Timed. All by one creative mind; and, based on my real-life experiences, so in a very real way, they are totally alive!

        <br/><br/>

        I‚Äôm not chasing flash. I‚Äôm surfing <strong>passion</strong>! Understated. Epic. Unmistakably me; but, passion none the less!

<h4>2016 - 2023</h4>
<h4 class="subheading">Mastered CSS Animation: <br/>Worked Independently.</h4>
</div>
<div class="timeline-body">
<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">I've been building websites professionally since 2016, working with everyone from small business owners to massive organizations like IBM and the Department of Defense. Many of my clients came to me after buying fancy websites they didn‚Äôt have the time or skills to maintain. I stepped in not only to keep things running, but to help them understand what was working, what wasn‚Äôt, and how to fix it. Along the way, I gained firsthand knowledge about how decisions get made inside big corporations versus small businesses‚Äîand what it really takes to get results in each world. Whether it was working as a solo entrepreneur or as part of a team buried under layers of subcontracting, I learned how to adapt and deliver.

<br/>
<br/>

Now I've mastered CSS Animation, which is a very specialized application of multimedia, web, graphic, hand-coding, timing, and technical savvy. It‚Äôs where art meets engineering. I use it to bring websites and digital content to life‚Äîadding movement, rhythm, and emotion to things most people think of as static. It‚Äôs a rare skill, and I‚Äôve made it my signature. It‚Äôs not just about making things look cool (though they do); it‚Äôs about making digital experiences feel natural, fluid, and alive. 

<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's Next?</strong> What's next is that I'm going to animate these tiny experiences and 'time them' to DJ-mixed music I make. I may animate them to commercial music or I may choose Flirty-POP EDM. I haven't decided. But it'll be epic (in an under-stated way; I guarantee that!

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Michael initially struggled with pricing his services, inadvertently undercharging for the quality he provided. This led to attracting clients who undervalued his work, often expecting services for free. Through these challenges, Michael learned the importance of establishing clear legal agreements to ensure payment for services rendered. To further enhance his skills, he enrolled in Full Sail University, aiming to refine his craft even though his quality was already well-regarded. However, the difficulty in holding clients accountable eventually prompted Michael to leave school and focus on finding stable work opportunities instead.

<div class="timeline-body">
<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from American University, Michael applied his education and experience to develop Phantom Records' website into a rich, multimedia, database-driven site. After updating the site to the most modern it can be, his employer, Phantom Records, moved the site into maintenance mode. Without a site to apply his talents, Michael negotiated the option to take on contracts that would allow him to remain current and broaden his skill set. Between 2013 and now, Michael completed several contracts building sites for the TSA, the Glenmont United Methodist Church, and a start-up government contractor.

<br/>
<br/>

Now that Michael has demonstrated his ability to create modern, database-driven websites, he is broadening his skill set with bleeding-edge Web Design, JavaScript Web Development, and Data Visualization Programming for the NIH. Michael's longer-term plan is to master both the creative and technical aspects of creating electronic experiences. Additionally, he is under the direction of his mentor, learning the software development lifecycle to round out his skills with project management and business development. In a few years, his expertise will equip him to contribute to enterprise-level, web-based projects and step in at any stage to ensure the beauty of its design, the soundness of its programming, and the success of the project through professional project management. He will be a valuable asset on any web-based project.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after Michael was hired at a promising new start-up, the tragic events of 9/11 led investors to withdraw funding, forcing the company to shut down. With start-up funding drying up across Silicon Valley, Michael decided it was the perfect opportunity to return to school. Seeking a more fulfilling educational experience, he moved to the East Coast and enrolled at American University, where he designed a unique degree program combining Graphic Design, Multimedia, and Web Programming. This initiative led to Michael earning the only Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Design and Development in the University's history. While attending school part-time, he worked part-time to immediately apply his studies to real-world projects. On May 8, 2011, he graduated with a 3.49 GPA and was honored to walk with the University‚Äôs top-performing students.

<h4>1996 - 2000</h4>
<h4 class="subheading">Overseas Travel - Web Research.</h4>
</div>
<div class="timeline-body" style="text-align:justify;">
<p class="text-muted">When traveling between school and work became too grueling, Michael's high school friend invited him to move to New Zealand for a change of pace. There, Michael created an online video game retailer that received 1.2 million hits in its first year. He and his partner made the front page of New Zealand's largest newspaper and were featured on television as an innovative, technology-based retailer. At the time, theirs was the only website featuring videos of gameplay to overcome buyer's reluctance and give customers a preview of gameplay before purchasing. A little-known fact about Michael is that Amazon.com cited Michael's website, www.gamescape.co.nz, in its Patent document US7792705. You can copy and paste this link to see that document and search for www.gamescape.co.nz to see Michael's citation at: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7792705">patents.google.com</a>.

<br/>
<br/>

During the time Michael was in New Zealand, the dot-com bubble started growing. Unemployment in the U.S. hit an all-time low of 4.6%. Tech companies were searching high and low for creative talent to fuel innovative start-ups. When Michael's parent learned of this, they made Michael move back to the United States to seek more lucrative employment than they estimated he would find in New Zealand. Michael was engaged to get married and he was forced to break off his engagement and leave his girlfriend. It set a stage for a tumultuous relationship with his parents from then onward.


<br/>
<br/>

Michael moved back to the United States to leverage his experience in his New Zealand start-up and grow his experience in the larger, more competitive U.S. market. In Los Gatos, California, Michael learned the value of separating the front-end from the back-end so specialized talent can be more productive. Michael was promoted to Product Manager after creating a prototype to redesign his employer's software interface based on user feedback. Later, he was promoted to Director of User Interface Design. Michael's work helped sell their web application and their start-up for several hundred thousand dollars and won Michael an invitation to join the same executive team at their next start-up.

<p class="text-muted">After feeling disconnected from the workforce for too long, yet realizing he needed to remain current with evolving technologies, Michael decided to take a new approach: to work while going to school. He took a job at a computer store as a salesperson and technician so he could personally build the products he sold. He also attended animation school to continue his pursuit of digital design. He learned customer service and technical support and then moved on to network administration, obtaining his Novell Netware Certification and earning $60 an hour doing network "house calls." Michael's boss called his computers "bullet-proof." It may have had something to do with Michael's 27-step preparation plan used on every computer he built.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Michael left the University of San Francisco for a once-in-a-lifetime internship at Skywalker Ranch with his idol, George Lucas. Michael became an IT Assistant at the George Lucas Educational Foundation where he improved his computer support skills while studying the convergence of education and technology in the Foundation's specialized education technology library. He also used Mozilla during its first launch and was excited about his future. Researching the Foundation's library revealed a computer animation school in Sunnyvale, California. Immediately following his internship's end, Michael applied, was accepted, enrolled and moved to Sunnyvale to attend.

Back then, computers were slower and relatively more expensive. Michael learned to design on a small black and white screen using Super Paint on a Mac SE/30 and ran the mail merge for the studio's marketing campaign using Microsoft Word. The company was attempting a Work from Home model and if only A.I. had been available then, we could have done it, successfully. Work from Home offices are less likely to suffer a pandemic and less likely to spread infectious disease between workers.

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align:justify;">You‚Äôve seen animation in Pixar films, or classic movie intros like The Matrix and Spider-Man. But my work lives in a different space‚Äîcloser to UI interaction and digital storytelling.

<br/>
<br/>

I design motion graphics for the web and immersive experiences, from CSS button hover effects to music-synced 3D character animations.

<br/>
<br/>

Using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, After Effects, and Adobe Aero, I bring interfaces and characters to life‚Äîsometimes even rigging motion capture of my own dance moves to humanoid assets.

<br/>
<br/>

Think: mini animated moments that are timed to music, enhance a user experience, or simply make digital design feel alive.

"Motion Graphics" are animations created to show in video footage. I majored in the science of multimedia, including web, animation, or video-displayed-animations (motion graphics). Those are animation that are specifically created to appear "on top of" video footage. In the video attached here, all of the text is animated. The footage was captured from source DVDs and then I added music to the background for the right vibe. I also selected and editing the timing in all of the footage and chose all of the tranisitions. I used Adobe Creative Cloud, and Apple Final Cut Pro to do this. You can't tell which parts are original and which parts are from the DVDs I captured or from the Xbox console I capture while playing video games to illustrate the point I am making in this video because the style I chose for my work blends so seamelessly in appearance and timing that you don't know which is which. That's because that's how talented I am. I did that deliberatel. Because that's what a professional does when they work to integrate their work within existing work.</p>

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">This text left here for die-hard animation fans. (Otherwise, it's too much information.) Michael created an interactive "mini game" animation to represent the "Peace Process" in an interesting way. He bought a dance pad with a USB cable connection. The dance pad is three feet by three feet wide. He then designed a "cover" for the pad. His "cover" was also three feet by three, designed in Adobe Photoshop and created at full print quality: 300DPI. That is an extremely large file and it was very time consuming to work with but Michael believes in quality and flexibility so he did it anyway. He had the "cover" printed at FedEx Office on to vinyl paper. The then "stuck" the "cover" on top of the dance pad so that his "pictures" precisely covered the dance pad's contact points. In other words, a dancer stepping on his "pictures" would activate the "hotspots" beneath the "cover" and send a signal into the "mini game" he created. The "mini game" was made in Adobe Flash, and he used a small Mac OS X utlitity to interpret the dance pad's "buttons" to send keyboard keystrokes depending on which one was "stepped on" or "pressed." The keystrokes were then mapped, within Flash, to activate certain animation sequences. During his design process, it was told to Michael that moving within Flash from one "Scene" to another the way Michael wanted was impossible. Michael searched Google for three days and found the same claim. So what did he do? He guessed. Based on the "syntax" of ActionScript, Michael created an original code sequence and it worked.</p><p></p>

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">"Kinetic Type" is a type of animation with moving text. Movies that have opening sequences with elaborate movements, such as the Spiderman movies, where the camera moves around the web hopping from one text phrase to another, are using "Kinetic Type" or "moving text." Michael used Adobe After Effects to create this animation. But with this one, he also used his DJ-skill to "time" the animation to the audio in the attached sound file. An author read their famous passage from "Lenore," and Michael animated the entire portion. This is only a portion, as the project was split between Michael and others. This is Michael's portion.</p>

In the United States, education underwent a significant transformation after the 1970s, when universities began charging tuition to U.S. citizens. Since then, higher education has become more costly than purchasing a home, especially when considering the opportunity cost. Unlike real estate, education doesn't appreciate in value over time. A degree itself holds no inherent economic worth‚Äîits value depends entirely on what the individual does with it.‚Äã

<br/><br/>

The diploma is proof of perseverance, not profit. It's a receipt for enduring a system that tests your ethics and character more than it prepares you for income. Employers recognize this. That's why they require a degree‚Äînot for your knowledge, but for the values your school believes you've demonstrated. Education in the U.S. ultimately tests whether someone can navigate complex systems while maintaining personal integrity.‚Äã

<br/><br/>

That's why this section exists. Our education tells you more about our values than our resume ever could.‚Äã

<br/><br/>

At my university, I graduated with honors‚Äînot just for academic achievement, but for meeting the school's high standards of character. I was the only student in my cohort ever appointed to two Judiciary Committees simultaneously, entrusted with twice the ethical responsibility of the average student. That's not a boast‚Äîit's a reflection of how seriously I took my role as a leader among my peers.‚Äã

<br/><br/>

Some individuals have attempted to distort this truth by misrepresenting backgrounds, including mine. Let me be clear: education is not about appearances or paper. It's about whether the experience reshaped your mind and provided you with critical thinking skills. If it didn't, it failed. Or maybe you did.‚Äã

<br/><br/>

Too many colleges now graduate students to maintain their funding. That wasn't my path. I chose an institution that's fully endowed and independent‚Äîone that doesn't hand out degrees to boost enrollment or attract grants. And that matters.‚Äã

<br/><br/>

Finally, a word of truth that may offend: no one addicted to nicotine, alcohol, or gambling who chain-smokes, chain-drinks, or chain-gambles is educated, no matter how many degrees they hold. Those are mind poisons. If education didn't help you escape those, then it didn't fix your thinking‚Äîand that's the whole point of getting an expensive education in the first place.‚Äã Whoever you are, wherever you are, we're not friends; we don't get along; so, don't smile at me; we're enemies.

<img alt="United Bank website screen" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/gamescape-dvd-menus.jpg"/>
<p>Michael designed a DVD menu system and edited the video using Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Motion, and DVD Studio Pro. He also created custom timed mixes to go with the introduction video that runs  when the DVD is inserted. He also narrated the audio commentary included in the  DVD's special features.</p>
<p>The DVD uses a naming convention  inspired by real-time strategy games. The main menu is called "Base  Camp." The chapters menu is called "Waypoints." And the special  features menu is called "Gear."</p>
<p>The "Gear" menu includes a  custom design featuring running videos that are clickable to jump to the  corresponding section of the DVD. Completing this effect required adding  Photoshop masks to the Final Cut footage in the exact shape of the monitor  screens in the background. The video appears to exist in the monitor, but in  fact it is floating on top.</p>

<p> Michael is working with this agile, smart, and small start-up government and commercial contractor to create a website that conveys the energetic culture of the growing company. He's using animation, third-party integration with Facebook, Twitter, and Google Fonts, an advanced Calendar with Facebook-based Event Scheduling, an employee scheduling web application, PayPal integration, and an overall look and feel that conveys the passion of the dynamic staff running this start-up.<br/><br/> As if that were not enough, Michael is using his upbringing in a family of lawyers to write customized, branded contracts for this Client. Management can now negotiate, organize, and construct a pool of talent based on professional, enforceable agreements that contain thorough coverage written in plain English. All of the contracts are vetted for Maryland legal validity by attorneys practicing in Maryland.<br/><br/>By leveraging his literary abilities with his talent for legal writing, Michael has saved thousands of dollars for his Client by providing their attorney with complete, well thought-out documents that clearly show what the Client is trying to achieve. It is not necessary to iterate the documents at the expensive hourly rate of a great attorney; with Michael's version, only a single iteration is needed to realize a binding contract retaining all the business nuance and complexity, with the legal power placed into the document by several professionally re-worked re-wordings of the contract's provisions. It is a very productive arrangement.</p>

<p>Michael created and produced this commercial DJ mix for Phantom Records. It features one of Will Smith's hit  singles, "Wild <span class="SpellE">Wild</span> West." It appeals to  pop music and rap fans because it includes one of Will Smith's greatest hits  apart from "Summertime." There are other old school hits such as  "The Humpty Dance" by Digital Underground, who are close personal  friends of Michael's. Digital Underground's head DJ, DJ Fuse, taught Michael to  DJ when Michael was in high school. One of the group's members is Michael's  best high school friend's relative. There is a long history of Michael and the music industry, and his talent for making music that energizes listeners has been among  his lesser-known abilities. <br/><br/>As passionate as Michael is about music, his "somewhat" shy nature (believe it or not) kept him from becoming a stage DJ. But don't take our word for it,  listen for yourself.</p>

<p>Michael created this Kinetic Type for a project with other team members. Each one had a section of audio and had to create their portion and then "stitch it" together with the other parts (of the poem). Michael animated his text and timed it to the audio while adding a storm to go with the mood of the narrative.</p>

<p>Michael created this Video Documentary and included original Animated Text made using Adobe Creative Cloud and Apple Final Cut Pro. It's impossible to know where his work begins and ends because it's expertly bleneded in. He recieved an A and the admiration of his classmates for his work with the timing and color treatments in his animated additions to the professional video footage he used in making this video. It was all used under public access copyright usage for his school work. A common use of commercial work for students in these programs.</p>

<p>Michael created this basic animation on a contract for AARP. The users consuming these animations were better served by simplifiied motion. The Supervising contact provided detailed, organized, and easy to understand design specs. Michael reports he enjoyed working on these even though he was working othter jobs at the same time due to getting hired more than he had predicted. He took too many jobs and learned how hard it is to work without sleeping. He says thanks, but no thanks, to sleep deprivation!</p>

Use of Cookies<br/><br/>This website may use "cookies" to help improve compatibility with  your browser / operating system combination by tracking the various  combinations that require special programming. In order to enhance your  experience by maintaining a consistent experience for you, it is sometimes  necessary to program parts of our site differently on our end, so that you  experience a consistent experience on your end.
