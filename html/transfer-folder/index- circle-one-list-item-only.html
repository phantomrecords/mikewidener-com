                Not everyone attends a high school renowned for honor, integrity, and creativity. Michael attended CPS in Oakland, California, where he acclimated to intellectual rigor, problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork through sports. The University of California recognizes CPS as an honors institution because all classes are taught at the honors level. Michael graduated with a 3.5 GPA, which, when adjusted for honors-level coursework, translates to a 4.5 GPA under the grading system used by post-secondary institutions and universities.
